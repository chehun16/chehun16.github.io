<p>This project was done at EHWA PAI lab.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>The goal of the project was to re-identify criminals using CCTV and <strong>gait</strong> information. </p>
<p>We analyzed gait patterns using <strong>IMU sensor data</strong> and developed a method to determine whether 
    two gait data sequences belong to the same person. The project took two IMU data inputs (3D joint coordinate sequences) 
    and transformed them into 128-dimensional feature vectors through FFT transformation and CNN. We then used Contrastive 
    Learning to calculate the similarity between vectors and, based on the final similarity score, determined whether the 
    two data points belong to the same person. I was responsible for data preprocessing, surveys, and modifying the model 
    architecture.</p>
